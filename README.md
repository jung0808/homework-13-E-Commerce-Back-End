# Homework-13: E-Commerce-Back-End

# Description

This was my homework #13 E-commerce Back end. I was tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying the starter code. I had to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MYSQL database.

I first started this homework by installing dependencies required to do this homework. Afterwards, I created the models in the models folder (Category, index, product, productTag, and Tag JS'. making sure that a specific product would reference correctly with the correct id.)

After all the models have been created, most of my work after that was working out of api folder. Specifically product-routes, tag-routes, and category-routes to perform create, read, updated, and delete (CRUD) operations using my Sequelize models.

The video is also attached to this homework in my readme at the bottom.

# Installation

1. Please type in "npm i" <br>
2. Install database by running "npm run seed.
3. Run the code by typing "node server.js"
4. Open Insomnia and try playing with CRUD under different api routes.
